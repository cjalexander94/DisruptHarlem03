		<h3>I am a recent graduate of Kean University, with a major in Finance and a minor in Economics. I have a strong knowledge of financial markets and current economic trends.  I have gained Finance experience working as an intern at EverBank Commercial Finance and  currently work as a project assistant at Northwestern Mutual.  I have participated in the Lockheed Martin Missions Systems and Training International Expansion Case Study where I played an integral role in pushing his team to win 1<sup>st</sup> place.  My professional interests include Investments, Coding and Leveraged loans. I have managed real-time simulation investment portfolios netting 12% return over 13 weeks. My personal motivations stem from wanting to expand financial literacy to minorities and lower income households. My goal is to use my passion for technology to help provide an avenue for people to gain financial knowledge and opportunities.</h3>
